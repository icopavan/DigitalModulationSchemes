This project gives a basic understanding about various types of digital modulation schemes.
The understanding is useful to know which modulation scheme to be used given few constraints
in the environment like SNR, transmitted power etc.

This project deals with comparision of various types of digital modulation schemes along the lines 
of SNR, power required to transmit and the distances between the constellation points. The about section
of the project gives more details about the project. The authors details are given in the "Authors" section
